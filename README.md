# Teco-Customer-Churn-Analysis (EDA)
ðŸ§  Project Overview

The Teco Customer Churn Analysis project is a comprehensive data analytics case study focused on understanding customer attrition patterns at a telecommunications company. The aim of this project was to uncover the most influential factors driving customer churn and to provide actionable insights that can help improve customer retention and long-term business performance.

This project involved both exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and advanced SQL queries to derive business intelligence from customer behavior and service usage data. It demonstrates my capability to work with real-world business data, draw meaningful conclusions, and visualize findings in a clear and impactful way.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective

The key objective of this project was to:

Identify patterns in customer churn behavior

Analyze the influence of contract types, payment methods, tenure, and demographics

Provide targeted recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer engagement

ðŸ“Œ Key Analytical Highlights

       1. Contract Types & Churn

Customers on month-to-month contracts had a churn rate of 42%, significantly higher than those on one-year (11%) and two-year (3%) contracts.

âž¤ Insight: Long-term contracts correlate strongly with higher retention and predictability.

2. Payment Methods & Churn

Customers using electronic checks had the highest churn rate at 45%, while those paying via credit card or bank transfer had churn rates of only 15â€“18%.

âž¤ Insight: Payment method trust and convenience play a role in customer satisfaction and loyalty.

3. Tenure & Churn Trends

Churn rate among customers with <1 year of tenure was 50%, dropping to 15% for those with 3+ years.

âž¤ Insight: The first year is the most critical phase for customer retention. Early engagement strategies are essential.

4. Service Type Analysis

Customers with Fiber Optic internet had a churn rate of 30%, compared to 20% for DSL.

âž¤ Insight: There may be quality-of-service concerns or market competition affecting Fiber users.

5. Demographic Impact â€“ Senior Citizens

Senior citizens (65+) exhibited a 41% churn rate compared to 26% for younger users.

âž¤ Insight: Tailored support and offers can help retain this vulnerable segment.

ðŸ“ˆ Techniques & Tools Used

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for documentation and reproducibility

SQL Queries for business reporting (documented in Questions.txt)

Customer segmentation

Revenue contributions

Retention rate calculations

Year-over-year growth and order trends

Data Visualization:

Churn by contract/payment/tenure

Trend lines, bar charts, and comparative plots

ðŸ§© Challenges Solved

Identified early churn signals and their relation to customer attributes.

Quantified the impact of service options and demographics on churn.

Designed SQL-based KPIs to supplement visual analysis for stakeholder-ready reporting.

âœ… Business Recommendations

Encourage long-term contracts through loyalty rewards or bundled pricing.

Discourage electronic check payments by incentivizing digital wallets or credit cards.

Develop onboarding programs to improve first-year retention.

Improve fiber optic customer experience through quality-of-service surveys and optimization.

Create support initiatives for senior citizens, including tutorials and discounts.

ðŸ§ª Outcome

This project not only uncovered significant drivers of customer churn but also translated complex data into simple, visual, and actionable intelligence for decision-makers. It reflects my ability to apply analytical thinking, business acumen, and technical tools to solve real-world problems and deliver insights that matter.
